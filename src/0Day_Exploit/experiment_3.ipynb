    "### Exploit-Dependent Probability Distribution Explanations\n",
    "#### Base Formula\n",
    "This distribution models the probability of completing exactly n exploits and failing on the (n+1)-st in a series of exploits with varying difficulty:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f_N(n) = (1 - q(e_{n+1})) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{n} q(e_k)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Where $q(e_k)$ is the probability of successfully executing exploit $e_k$ within a unit of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of \"q(e)\" in this Specific Case\n",
    "In the code, exploit success probability is defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q(e) = e^{-weight(e)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $weight(e)$ represents the difficulty/complexity of the exploit derived from CVE information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to formula (11) in the paper, where $q(e_k)$ represents the probability of success for exploit $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Explanation\n",
    "This distribution models attacker behavior with periodic defender checks but varying exploit difficulties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each edge (exploit) has a difficulty value derived from CVE data\n",
    "- Higher edge weights → lower success probability (more difficult exploit)\n",
    "- Lower edge weights → higher success probability (easier exploit)\n",
    "- Attacker movement depends on sequential success probabilities along a path\n",
    "- defense_rate not used since checks happen at known intervals\n",
    "- attack_rate not needed since progress is determined by exploit difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insight: Unlike the Poisson model where all steps have equal difficulty, this model accounts for real-world differences in exploit complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fits our intuition: When some exploits are harder than others, attackers must overcome varying challenges along their path, creating natural \"choke points\" that defenders can target."
